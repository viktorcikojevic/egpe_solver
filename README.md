# egpe_solver


Solves the coupled (nonlinear) Schr√∂dinger equation either in real or imaginary time. The implemented algorithm is outlined here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010465509001131

This code is used in the research of static and dynamic properties of two-component Bose-Bose quantum droplets
